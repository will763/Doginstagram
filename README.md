# Doginstagram 📖

After finishing the TQI Fullstack Developer bootcamp on the Digital innovation one platform,
I decided to put the contents seen into practice both on the frontend and on the backend. I developed
this web application, with the frontend based on Instagram design with ReactJs and the backend with SpringBoot. 
The advantage of this application is that you can only publish images that contain a dog, to verify this I used Ml5,
a Machine Leaning library
for javascript.

## Run on your machine 🧑‍💻

1. Clone this repository.

2. After cloning, then open the frontend folder in vscode and run the commands below.
```shell
 npm install 
```

```shell
 npm run dev 
```
3. Then open the backend folder in the intellij ide, wait for the dependencies to load and run the application's main class.

## Frontend 💻
  
### Built with 🏛️

## What I learned 🧑‍💻

In the frontend part I learned to use the ML5 library to check if the images really
contained dogs using the coco-ssd model, I also learned to use the SWR hook to query
the api and make the interface fluid. In the backend part I learned to use Jwt together
with Spring Security for the authentication and authorization part,  I also learned to create routes to 
receive parameters of the multipart/file type.
